\caption{Example of a human gene prediction using the \TransMap
algorithm. An alignment of a mouse mRNA to the genome is mapped
using chained BLASTZ alignments of the mouse genome to the human
genome, resulting in a prediction of the alignment of the mRNA to
the human genome. This example shows a deletion between each intron
going from mouse to human, and an insertion in the second exon.}
