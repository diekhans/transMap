     ideas to speed things up
       - order jobs to do genomes with larger chroms first (monDom4)
       - split up large source files; this is key to de-hippo-ing

    - netFilter -syn is losing way to much in Platypus

      hg18 28way:
            An additional filtering step was introduced in the
            generation of the 28-way conservation track to reduce the number
            of paralogs and pseudogenes from the high-quality assemblies and
            the suspect alignments from the low-quality assemblies: the
            pairwise alignments of high-quality mammalian sequences (placental
            and marsupial) were filtered based on synteny; those for 2X
            mammalian genomes were filtered to retain only alignments of best
            quality in both the target and query ("reciprocal best").

   baseColorDrawSetup: NM_001077235.1-1.1: mRNA size (5807) != psl qSize (5820)
   sequence size is 5820 bp in NCBI, fasta file was corrupted is corrupt
   in the data directory.
        corrupt in vertebrate.2008-06-07/data/canFam2/refSeq.fa.bz2

   Maybe related to other corruption encountered during build??
   Just deleted alignments as quick fix.

       - looks like using /dev/stdout instead of stadout fixes the problem

     - searching path put in cluster jobs was modified to avoid /cluster/home, as it dragged down
       server

   - exclude equCab2, since it's chains still have the bogus chr27.
   
   - hippos with mondom5: hg19 mRNA w 529 sequences, 999887 bases
     - address with prefiltering of alignments

  - forgot to look for lastz directories, just start over.

  - builds/vertebrate.2009-07-01/
  - delete old track, use dumps to find out


2009-08-03:
      - suggestion from Michael Hiller <hillerm@stanford.edu> on better net
        filtering.

            > Has anyone done any netFilter turning for more species more distant 
            > that human/mouse?
            >   
            But I think apart from distance, the "scaffoldedness" of the query 
            should be considered. Small scaffolds by definition can never meet the 
            strict criteria of min score, length etc.

       See http://genomewiki.ucsc.edu/index.php/Hg19_Genome_size_statistics
       for alignment types used in MAF.

       Maybe should still use netfilter for distant orgs, only not with -syn.
