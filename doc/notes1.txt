     ideas to speed things up
       - order jobs to do genomes with larger chroms first (monDom4)
       - split up large source files; this is key to de-hippo-ing

    - netFilter -syn is losing way to much in Platypus

      hg18 28way:
            An additional filtering step was introduced in the
            generation of the 28-way conservation track to reduce the number
            of paralogs and pseudogenes from the high-quality assemblies and
            the suspect alignments from the low-quality assemblies: the
            pairwise alignments of high-quality mammalian sequences (placental
            and marsupial) were filtered based on synteny; those for 2X
            mammalian genomes were filtered to retain only alignments of best
            quality in both the target and query ("reciprocal best").
