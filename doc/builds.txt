      ####  lessons learned ####
      - should do pslCDnaFilter before pslRecalcMatch
      - should filter mapInfo in process of filter alignments.
      - cds file, other meta-data doesn't include version
      - save raw mapping info file for debugging
      - save list of chain ids that survive synteny filter

     ### FIXME:
         - Platypus chrX5:19,857,926-19,870,630   
           why no human mapping?? NM_003329.2 
         - tupBel1 - no transmap
         AJ412038, in Orangutan search fails!

2008-06-09:
     - build vertebrate.2008-06-07 to use more diverse filtering,
     - due to corruption create chkForAsciiData:
            data/dasNov1/mrna.fa.bz2	/dev/stdin: data
            data/loxAfr1/mrna.fa.bz2	/dev/stdin: data
       rebuild these by hand, still don't know why its happening

     
2008-06-23:
      - modified to use all, rbest, or syn
      - dropped chrom partition, this was not needed after the addition of overlapSelect.
      - need to make smaller psl input files, a hand full of hippos on pslRecalcMatch
      - max # of open files causes grief for partitioning, add forced close hack.

      - submitted all databases on hgwbeta for QA.

      * PSL tracks not sorted!! reloaded them.

      - some issues:
      
        1. What about pileups?  There are no filters to limit the display of 
        many alignments like there are for ESTs.  It also doesn't do the normal 
        EST thing where it displays a certain number and then crams everything 
        else into a single line.  So, for example, you can't get TransMap ESTs 
        out of dense mode on anoCar1 scaffold_7220.

        - performance: tracks take a very long time to load all of chr1 in 
        either dense or full mode, and sometimes it just results in a white screen.

        - equCab2 is not on the RR yet -- what about links to it in other orgs' 
        details pages?

        - what about pileups? Can't get ESTs out of dense on anoCar1 
        scaffold_7220.  There are no filters to limit the display of many 
        alignments, and maxItems in trackDb doesn't limit the display, either. 
        -- mark is looking at this.  We won't hold up the release for it.

        - search is not working -- fixed 7/15, except mRNA and EST exact matches 
        are overriding transMap matches.  Also, an exact match does not actually 
        open the track if it is in hide.

2009-09-13
      - builds/vertebrate.2009-09-13
      - include lastz alignments as well as blastz alignments
      - delete old track, use dumps to find out
      - build with Makefile
      - add blurb to browser make docs
      - build for all rr-genomes that have transMap tracks as well as the
        latest genomes.

          /cluster/data/croPor0/bed/lastz.galGal3/axtChain/croPor0.galGal3.rbest.chain.gz 
         probably due to it not being an official build.  Edit job files to remove these
       - allMis0 - don't know what this is, but shouldn't do *0 assemblies.
