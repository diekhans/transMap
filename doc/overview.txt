Terminology

  - source assembly (srcDb) - genome from which transcripts are obtained, identified
    by UCSC database.
  - source id (srcId) - identifier for the source transcript sequence in the form
    srcDb:acc.ver
  - source alignment id (srcAlignId) - unique id of the source alignment or annotation
    in the form srcId-uniqmod, where unique mod is integer.
  - accession (acc) - basic identifier in the source database, this doesn't include version
  - accession version (accv) - fully accession with version number, which describes
    a unique sequence.
  - transMap source database (transMapSrcDb) - A sqlite3 database created to hold all of
    the source data for the mapping jobs.


Overview of TransMap algorithm implementation for cross-species cDNA alignments:

  - Identify desired set of source genomes that have the desired set of
    native cDNA alignments.
   
  - Identify desired set of destination genomes that have chains and nets from
    one or more source organisms, resulting in pairs of source/destination
    genome.

  - For each source genome obtain and save
    - PSL alignments of the source cDNAs, with the cDNA accession.version turned into 
      unique alignment ids using pslQueryUniq.  For example two alignments of
      DQ592480.1 results in ids DQ592480.1-1 and DQ592480.1-2.

    - FASTA file of cDNA sequences

    - Tab-separated file of meta data, consisting of:
           acc   geneCDS   geneName   type

       - acc is the accession.version
       - geneCDS is the CDS, in genbank format, or empty if no CDS
       - geneName is the gene name (symbol) or empty if not available
       - type - type of sequence, never actually used
         
     for example:
       AB212816.1	10..1005	GnRHR1/III-1	mRNA

  - For each source/destination genome pair and a given set of source alignments:

    - Select set of chains to use for the mapping.  The browser vertebrate
      alignments use syntenic chains for alignments with branch lengths
      of no more than 0.5, as computed by phyloFit.  All chains are used
      for more distance genomes.

      - To select syntenic chains, use the netFilter and netChainSubset commands.
        The netChainSubset -wholeChains option selects changes without truncating
        them to match the net to prevents gene fragmentation.  Here is an example
        to create chains for mapping human mRNAs to mouse:

           chainDir=/cluster/data/mm8/bed/blastz.hg18/axtChain
           netFilter -syn $chainDir/mm8.hg18.net.gz >mm8.hg18.syn.net
           netChainSubset -wholeChains mm8.hg18.syn.net $chainDir/mm8.hg18.all.chain.gz mm8.hg18.syn.chain

    - For large genomes, it maybe necessary to partition chains by destination chromosome,
      attempting to map all source cDNAs through each partition.  This is not covered
      in this overview.

    - Use pslMap to create cross-species alignments, saving the mapping information:
      
         pslMap -chainMapFile -mappingPsls=mrna.mm8.hg18.raw.mapinfo mrna.hg18.psl mm8.hg18.syn.chain mrna.mm8.hg18.raw.psl

    - Filter alignments to remove small
