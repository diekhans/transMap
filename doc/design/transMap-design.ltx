\section{Data Model}

Source genomes are genome assemblies with from which annotations are mapped to
target genome assemblies.  A genome maybe both a source and target genome,
although not all target genomes will annotations making them suitable to be
source genomes.

For a given TransMap release consists of a fixed set of source genomes.  New
target genomes maybe added to a given release, however source genomes and
already mapped target genomes are not changed until a new release.

\subsection{Source annotations}



The following sources annotations sets maybe use from a
*** GENBANK mRNAs
*** GENBANK splice ESTs
*** Ensembl full gene annotations (not projection), including GENCODE
** The following data is required for each annotation:
*** PSL alignments, with unique ids.  These can be actual alignments or artificial
    alignments generated from genome annotations. PSLs are stored in big PSL format.  
*** FASTA of sequences.  These are index by samtools.
*** metadata: base transcript less unique suffix, CDS, and gene name, gene id, gene type
