why:
   - alignments optimized for different tasks
   - preexisting alignments and annotationss
   
uses:
   - cross species cDNA alignmest
   - haplotype mapping
   - protein->cDNA->genome mappoing


progs:
   pslTransMap
   bedTransMap

error cases:
   - tandem duplications
   - misaligned splices sites due to BLASTZ not being transcript aware
   - blastz chaining problems
   - blat mismatch problems
   - chaining and netting problems.
   - definition of synteny.
