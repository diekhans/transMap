Terminology

  - source assembly (srcHgDb) - genome from which transcripts are obtained, identified
    by UCSC database.
  - source id (srcId) - identifier for the source transcript sequence in the form
    srcHgDb:acc.ver
  - source alignment id (srcAlignId) - unique id of the source alignment or annotation
    in the form srcId-uniqmod, where unique mod is integer.
  - accession (acc) - basic identifier in the source database, this doesn't include version
  - accession version (accv) - fully accession with version number, which describes
    a unique sequence.
  - destination assembly (destHgDb) - genome to which transcripts are mapped,
    identified by UCSC database.
  - source transcript database (srcDb) - A sqlite3 database to hold all of the
    source data for the mapping jobs (alignments, transcript sequences,
    metadata)
  - genome database (genomeDb) - A sqlite3 database with information about
    active genomes, including which source transcripts and chains are
    available.
  - mappingChains, mappingChainsIndexDb - filtered chain file for mappings,
    along with a sqlite3 databases index by query range.  These are temporary,
    for the life of a run.  They will be used by multiple batches for
    different source types.
  - build type (full, incremental) - a full build builds all source datasets
    and mappings.  An incremental will obtain new source data and do mappings
    to new genomes from both existing and new source data.  Existing sources
    or mappings are not rebuilt, even though there might be newer source
    data available.  The goal of the incremental is to create mappings
    to new assemblies.

Pipeline:

The pipeline is controlled by Luigi, which in turn runs parasol batches for
larger compute tasks.

  - Build new genomeDb to reflect state of system.

  - Generate list of target destHgDbs, this is the latest of each active
    genome, plus a specific list of older genomes.

  - Generate list of srcHgDbs that have chains to each target destHgDb

  - Define tasks to build missing srcDb databases for each of
    the srcHgDbs for all annotation types. This is not a time
    dependency, srcDbs are built only if they don't exist.
    A srcDb contains the alignments, sequences and metadata
    for each source transcript for a particular type.

  - Define task to build mapping chains databases for all pairs
    of srcHgDb/destHgDb mappings to build build

  - Define task to do mappings.
