     ideas to speed things up
       - order jobs to do genomes with larger chroms first (monDom4)
       - split up large source files; this is key to de-hippo-ing

    - netFilter -syn is losing way to much in Platypus

      hg18 28way:
            An additional filtering step was introduced in the
            generation of the 28-way conservation track to reduce the number
            of paralogs and pseudogenes from the high-quality assemblies and
            the suspect alignments from the low-quality assemblies: the
            pairwise alignments of high-quality mammalian sequences (placental
            and marsupial) were filtered based on synteny; those for 2X
            mammalian genomes were filtered to retain only alignments of best
            quality in both the target and query ("reciprocal best").

   sequence size is 5820 bp in NCBI, fasta file was corrupted is corrupt

        corrupt in vertebrate.2008-06-07/data/canFam2/refSeq.fa.bz2

   Maybe related to other corruption encountered during build??
   Just deleted alignments as quick fix.

       - looks like using /dev/stdout instead of stadout fixes the problem

     - searching path put in cluster jobs was modified to avoid /cluster/home, as it dragged down
       server

   - exclude equCab2, since it's chains still have the bogus chr27.
   
   - hippos with mondom5: hg19 mRNA w 529 sequences, 999887 bases
     - address with prefiltering of alignments

      - suggestion from Michael Hiller <hillerm@stanford.edu> on better net
        filtering.

            > Has anyone done any netFilter turning for more species more distant 
            > that human/mouse?
            >   
            But I think apart from distance, the "scaffoldedness" of the query 
            should be considered. Small scaffolds by definition can never meet the 
            strict criteria of min score, length etc.

       See http://genomewiki.ucsc.edu/index.php/Hg19_Genome_size_statistics
       for alignment types used in MAF.

       Maybe should still use netfilter for distant orgs, only not with -syn.

   - maintain transmap on all genomes on the public server
   - drop transmap on loxAfr1 and oryCun1, as not public and newer
     genomes are available

  - vertebrate.2009-10-13 build
  - bug discovered in previous version where multiple identical PSLs cause mapinfo to be lost.
    fixed both pslMapInfoSelect and change runTransMap to remove duplicated PSLs with sort.
  - create build directory, copy and edit Makefile.  Update list of public genomes to keep.
  - build with these steps:

    Could I get a transMap for nasLar1 and rhiRox1 ?  They both have
    chain/nets to hg38 and tarSyr2 browsers completed shortly after you
    finished the recent update.
