* transMapBatch has a lot of assumption about file structure that are not in other tools:

 ../transMap/bin/mappingChainBuild build/2024-01/data/genome.db hg38 $dest syn build/2024-01/data/chains/hg38.${dest}.chain.gz
../transMap/bin/transMapJobWrapper etc/transMapBuildConf.py hg38 chlSab2 ensembl syn 1 501 /hive/users/markd/projs/transMap/ian-primates-run/build/2024-01/build/batches/chlSab2/hg38/ensembl/results/parts/1.501.preBigPsl

 gets build/2024-01/data/chains/hg38/chlSab2/hg38.chlSab2.syn.chain.db

should be clear where required files should go or how to run this outside of a full run.

* do the clear batch magic so don't have to keep creating new batch directorie

* why so many discovered DBs dropped, like
